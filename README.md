# Hands on assignments for Rails
A small set of hands-on assignments on rails for interview candidates.

## Instructions: 
 - All the solutions should be stored in a public git repository. It can be [github](github.com), [gitlab](gitlab.com) or anything else but clone-able publicly.
  - There is a `README.md` or `README.txt` in the repository. This can contain your notes to the evaluator, how to run if its not default etc. 
  - Each solution is placed in a git branch with prefix sol_N, so that `git checkout sol_2` will take us to the solution for question number 2.
  - Commit everything to the respository e.g. archives (zips, tars), binaries etc. 
  - Rails is running on production mode.
  - Extra files which do not belong to the rails home can be placed in separate folders and documented in `README`.

### Mandatory questions

#### 1. Create a rails application which shows `Hello Cloudronics!` on index page
